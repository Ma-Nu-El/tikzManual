* Notes
- This is a long +ass+ book
- I'm trying to make a summary of the parts of this book. Then I'll do a
  summary of this summary with only the figures and the corresponding code.
  This is because the book --- as far as I've read --- goes telling the
  tips in a story-line fashion, which is /very/ good for learning purposes, but
  not so much as a reference tool. Super recommended for newbies like me.
- Also, I'm reading the =.pdf= where as having the =org= source code for
  it might be handy for the future me.


- I haven't been able to generate the TikZ images for =.html= output of this
  =.org= file; just the =.pdf= output for the moment.
